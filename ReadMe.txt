This is a work in progress calculator that is intended to make common electrical engineering problems easier 
to solve. In addition, the intention is to add functions that demonstrate concepts graphically to allow for long
term retention of information. 

Contact me if you would like me to add additional functions that you think are important. Suggestions and feedback 
is appreciated.
